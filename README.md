# numbertobinary

This program reads a string of numbers that the user inputs (*Example:  "23 43 55 ").  The program takes this list of seprate number
and converts them to binary form.

*The program seperates the numbers by keeping track of the index positions of the spaces.  Becuase of this, a space is needed at the end
of the string in order to seperate the last digit as well.
